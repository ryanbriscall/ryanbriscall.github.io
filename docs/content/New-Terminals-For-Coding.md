There's a new terminal, called [Cmder](http://cmder.net/).

It's portable, and integrates with [Git-for-Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

In fact, one of it's download options includes Git-for-Windows.

Here's a quote from their website.

> *"Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows. It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout, looking sexy from the start."*
>
> *"... all the magic of Cmder is happening through [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)."*

I remember using [Console](https://sourceforge.net/projects/console/) long ago, then I moved onto [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/), and now we have [Cmder](http://cmder.net/).


That's all.

If you're tired of constantly moving from terminal to terminal though, then consider sticking to the bare minimum, the GitBash terminal, provided from installing [Git-for-Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

Once you're rested, consider taking on Cmder, aka cmder.
