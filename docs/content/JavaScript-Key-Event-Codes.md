You can find a reference chart at the deprecated [KeyboardEvent.keyCode document on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode#keyCode_of_punctuation_keys_on_some_keyboard_layout)

There's now a site, [keycode.info](https://keycode.info/), where you can type in a key and see it's information.

There you will see the newer `event.code` which can provides a human-friendly key name of the key (or readable enum).

Note: The [event.which](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/which) and [event.keyCode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode) have been deprecated.

See some [pre-defined key values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values) at MDN.
