Every day, I had to re-login to the admin of a WordPress site I was developing.

There are a number of solutions to this, but I wanted a more universal, and less technical, solution for anyone to do.

I always imagine that I'm not the first, if not only, person to experience this issue.  So if I make a solution, I want to make the easiest, most compatible, solution possible so that anyone can do it.

So, I decided that the best solution would be a WordPress plugin.

With a WordPress plugin, anyone, on any system, on any platform, could have this solution and install it by only a couple of mouse clicks.

So I made a plugin and released it a few days ago, called [(rb) AutoLogin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rb-autologin/advanced/).  Extremely lightweight.  Only 15 lines of code.

Now just go to your WordPress plugins, and search for AutoLogin, and install.

Be sure to follow the instructions of adding the login setting to your `wp-config.php` file.

That's it.

Enjoy!
