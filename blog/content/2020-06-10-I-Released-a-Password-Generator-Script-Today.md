Have you ever wanted a simple password generator, as a single .html file, that you could run offline?

Well, I have.

So I made a simple password generator and released it today on GitHub, called [SimplePasswordGenerator](https://github.com/ryanbriscall/SimplePasswordGenerator).

You can save it and run it offline.

Even save it to your USB stick too, as part of your collection of offline .html web apps/tools!

That's it.

Enjoy!
