Have you ever wanted a virtual keyboard to use for typing (using click/touch keys)?

Well, I have.

So I made a simple virtual keyboard and released it today on GitHub, called [SimpleVirtualKeyboard](https://github.com/ryanbriscall/SimpleVirtualKeyboard).

I used it in an "access panel" fashion; essentially an authentication (enter password) page.

I think some people will enjoy the user experience (UX) it provides; letting users simply touch keys instead of typing on their keyboard, or using the popup keyboard on their phone, etc.

I also like the security aspect in that this removes one additional attack surface by preventing hackers keyboard-logging your device.

That's it.

Enjoy!
